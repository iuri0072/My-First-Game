# 2D Pixel Art Platformer - My First Game

Welcome to my first 2D pixel art platform game made in Unity using C#. This project has been a great learning experience for me, as I've learned how to import assets, add serialized fields, use public and private classes, create animations, draw and animate pixel art, implement a death count throughout scenes, create a global game timer, publish the game on itch.io and even more features.

A special thanks to Florian Walther from the YouTube channel Coding in Flow for the tutorial that helped me create this game.

## Known Issues
- Jump sound keeps on playing after death and before player respawn
- Death icon is not displayed correctly in the published version
- Player movement is not locked after the end of a level

## Future Improvements
- Add a timer for individual levels
- Create a ranking system for runs
- Add at least 2 more levels for level design

## How to Play
1. Acess the game web page at itch.io: https://iuri0072.itch.io/my-first-game
2. Extract the files and run the executable or play it online
3. Use the arrow keys (or WASD) to move left and right, and the spacebar to jump
4. Collect cherries and avoid obstacles to reach the flag at the end of the level - it is required to collect all cherries to unlock the flag
5. Keep track of your deaths and try to beat your own high score

## Conclusion
I hope you enjoy playing my 2D pixel art platformer game. I would love to hear your feedback and any suggestions you have for future improvements. Thank you for trying it out!
